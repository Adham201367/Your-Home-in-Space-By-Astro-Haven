        <ul>
            <li>The first successful American space station It was a major achievement for NASA and demonstrated the United States' ability to build and operate a manned space station.</li>
            <li>Conducting numerous scientific experiments Hundreds of experiments have been conducted in fields such as space science, medicine, and materials science, helping scientists understand the effects of zero gravity on the human body, plants, and materials.</li>
            <li>Observing the Earth and the Sun It was equipped with powerful telescopes and cameras to observe the Sun and atmospheric phenomena on Earth, and helped study solar winds and sunspots.</li>
            <li>Significant engineering expertise He helped develop technologies for life support, waste management, and energy storage in space, all of which were later used in larger projects like the International Space Station.</li>
            <li>Long-term stays in space Astronauts spent months in space, which helped understand the effects of prolonged stays in space on the human body.</li>
